# FM-partition
This is a FM partition algorithm that can handle graph partition, and concerning the node size constraint, while minimizing the cutsize.

For usage:
You can use make to get a exectable file. The default name of the exe file is FM_N26124963

For Command:
You can use the format ./{exe_filename} {nodes file} {nets file} {out file} to execute
while the nodes file is the .nodes file, nets file is tthe .nets file, and it will give an ouput .out file.
For example:
  ./FM_N26124963 FM/benchmark/adaptec1.nodes FM/benchmark/adaptec1.nets FM/benchmark/adaptec1.out
